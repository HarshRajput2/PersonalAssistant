Start by downloading and installing the eSpeak speech synthesizer from this link: http://espeak.sourceforge.net/download.html
After installation, make sure to place the "espeak.exe" application in the same directory where your C++ application is stored.

For enabling speech output, you can use the following steps:

1. Define the message you want to be spoken as a text string.
2. Construct a command that utilizes the eSpeak tool to vocalize the message.
3. Execute the constructed command using the system function in your C++ program.
4. To open files with specific formats on your system, use the "ShellExecute" function with the appropriate file path. Ensure that you replace single backslashes with double backslashes in the file path.
   Go with: ShellExecute(NULL,"open","file path",NULL, NULL, SW_NORMAL);
5. To open a web browser, you can launch it with the system command, specifying the URL you want to visit.
   For ex: system("start https://www.youtube.com");
6. To run executable files such as Microsoft Word, Paint, Excel, or Notepad, you can use the "CreateProcess" function in your C++ program.
   Go with: CreateProcess(TEXT("file path"), NULL, NULL, NULL, FALSE, NULL, NULL, NULL, &startInfo, &processInfo); 
7. For playing audio, you can use the "mciSendString" function with the appropriate commands to open and play audio files.
   Go with: mciSendString("open \"path of audio\" type mpegvideo alias mp3", NULL, 0, NULL);
            mciSendString("play mp3", NULL, 0, NULL);
